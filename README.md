# Spark Machine Learning Workshop for Information Commons

This repository contains workbooks and scripts for using SparkML to do supervised text classification.

The workbooks and python scripts are set up to run in local context. For instructions on how to run them on the information commons cluster, check the information commons wiki at: https://wiki.library.ucsf.edu/display/IC/UCSF+Information+Commons+Wiki
